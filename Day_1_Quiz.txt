Day 1 Quiz!

Please use any and all resources at your disposal to complete this quiz. That means, the internet, the CodingNomads platform, the labs, and/or anything else. Take as much time as you need. If you finish before others please feel free to take a break, do some studying, send me any questions on Slack etc.

Section 1 - Fundamentals:

1) What defines "a block" of code?

grouping of two or more statements
enclosing the statements between opening and closing curly braces
 logical unit that can be used any place that a single statement can

2) What is "variable scope"?
Scope refers to the visibility of variables. In other words, which parts of your program can see or use it
Once defined, every part of your program can access a variable
very useful to be able to limit a variable's scope to a single function

3) What defines "variable scope"?

In Java, the scope of a local variable is the body of the method in which it is declared.

4) What are Java's primitive data types? Please list them and briefly explain them.

boolean - 1 bit, stores true or false values
byte - 8 bits or 1 byte, store whole number between -128 to 127
int - 32 bits or 4 bytes, stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
short - 16 bits or 2 bytes, stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
char -  16 bits or 2 bytes, stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
long -  64 bits or 8 bytes, stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float - 32 bits or 4 bytes, stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double - 64 bits or 8 bytes, stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits


5) What are Java's arithmetic operators? Please demonstrate all of them.

+	Addition	 int i = 2 + 2; 	i == 2
-	Subtraction	 int i = 4 - 2; 	i == 2
*	Multiplication	 int i = 2 * 2; 	i == 4
/	Division	int i = 4 /2;	i == 2
%	Modulus	 int i = 5 % 3; 	i == 2

6) What are Java's relational operators? Please demonstrate all of them.

<	Less Than	 1 < 2 	True
<=	Less Than or Equal To 	3 <= 3	True
>	Greater Than	3 > 4	False
>=	Greater Than or Equal To 	3 >= 3	True
==	Equal To	 2 == 2	True
 !=	Not Equal To 	 3 != 2	 True

7) What are Java logical operators? Please demonstrate all of them?

&	AND
&&	Short-Circuit AND
|	OR
||	Short-Circuit OR
^	 XOR (One can be true but not both) 
 !	NOT 

8) What is a conditional statement in Java? Please show an example.

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if       to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else     to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if  to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch   to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

//example
//syntax
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}

9) What types of loops do we have in Java? Please demonstrate each of them.

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.


FOR LOOP
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:

//syntax
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
 }

Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

count = 0
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    System.out.println(i);
}

FOR EACH LOOP (ENHANCED FOR LOOP)
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:

//syntax
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
  System.out.println(i);
}


WHILE
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

//Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

DO WHILE
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

//syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);

int i = 0;
do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
while (i < 5);



10) What do the keywords "continue", "break", and "return" do?

Continue
continue	Continues to the next iteration of a loop

break	
Breaks out of a loop or a switch block

return
return	Finished the execution of a method, and can be used to return a value from a method


11) What is a Switch Statement? Please demonstrate.

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter

int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)

Section 2 - Introduction to Data Structures:

12) What is an Array?

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:

//examples
String[] cars;
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};


13) What is the difference between the length() of an Array and the final index of an Array?

length() is the size of an array 
final index is the size of an array - 1

for example:
length() = 5
final index = 5 - 1 = 4

14) How do we instantiate an Array of size 7? Please demonstrate.

int intArray[];    //declaring array
intArray = new int[20];  // allocating memory to array

OR

int[] intArray = new int[20]; // combining both statements in one

int [] array = new int [7];

15) Please write a for loop that will populate the Array you created above with the numbers two through twelve (start with 2 and increment by 2).

int [] array = new int [7];

for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i = i + 2){
 System.out.println(i);
}

16) Please write a for-each loop that will print each element in the Array above.

for(int x : array) {
            System.out.println(x);
        }

17) How do we declare a two-dimensional Array with a width of 7 and a height of 7? Please demonstrate?

A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.

To create a two-dimensional array, add each array within its own set of curly braces:

//example
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
int x = myNumbers[1][2];
System.out.println(x); // Outputs 7

18) Please demonstrate how to populate the 2D array above using a nest for loop?

We can also use a for loop inside another for loop to get the elements of a two-dimensional array (we still have to point to the two indexes):

public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
    for (int i = 0; i < myNumbers.length; ++i) {
      for(int j = 0; j < myNumbers[i].length; ++j) {
        System.out.println(myNumbers[i][j]);
      }
    }
  }
}

19) Please demonstrate how to print each element in the 2D array above using nested for-each loop.

int[][] array2d = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
for (int[] array : array2d) {
    for (int element : array) {
        System.out.print(element + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}

OR

int[][] numbers = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};
for (int[] array : numbers) {
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));
}

42) What does it mean to "throw" an exception?

43) What is the difference between the keywords "throw" and "throws"?

44) When catching multiple exceptions, why must we keep the "exception hierarchy" in mind?

45) Can we have a "try" without a "catch"?

46) Can we have a "try/catch" without a "finally"?


Section 5 - Input/Output:

47) What is a Byte Stream?

48) What is a Character Stream?

49) What is a very quickly clue that tells us whether we're looking at a Byte Stream or a Character Stream?

50) What is the difference between a Buffered Byte Stream and a traditional Byte Stream?

51) What is the difference between a Buffered Character Stream and a traditional Character Stream?

52) Please demonstrate how to create a Byte Stream and a Character Stream below. Both of these Streams should demonstrate how to read a file and print the contents to the console. (This is just a demonstration.)


Section 6 - MultiThreading:

53) What is multithreading?

Section 7 - Generics:

59) Why do we use Generics?

60) Please demonstrate a simple Generic Class definition.

60) Please demonstrate a simple Generic Method definition.

61) What does "bounded types" mean?

62) Please write a simple bounded Generic Method named sum() that takes in two parameters. These parameters can be ANY type of Number, but they must be a Number. This method will return a double which is the sum of the two method parameters.

62) What is an example of a Generic Class that we've already been using a bit in the prep course?


Section 8 - Enumerations:

63) What is an Enumeration?

64) When do we use Enumerations?

65) Please demonstrate a simple Enumeration below.

Hoorayyyy! You're done! 

Bonus Section!

Please write a method that will reverse the (int) elements inside an array. This method takes in an int[] array as an argument and reverse the elements in place. You cannot create a new array and copy elements from one array to the other, you must reverse the elements in place inside the original array. Once reversed, return the array back to the caller.

Please create a simple Rock-Paper_Scissors game that you can play on the console against the commputer. The computer must randomly choose it's play, and the user gets to manually choose their play. Best 2 out of 3 wins.


Hooray!! You're extra extra done!
